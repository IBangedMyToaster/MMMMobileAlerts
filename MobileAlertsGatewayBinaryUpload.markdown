# Gateway Binary Upload into the Cloud

The gateway sends data via a binary HTTP request to the data server according to configuration (standard: [http://www.data199.com/gateway/put](http://www.data199.com/gateway/put)). The `Content-Type` describes it as `application/octet-stream` and an additional header `HTTP_IDENTIFY` contains the following string: Gateway Serial + ":" + Gateway MAC + ":" + action code.

`HTTP_IDENTIFY: 80ABCDEF:006789ABCDEF:00` sent during boot-up of the gateway.
`HTTP_IDENTIFY: 80ABCDEF:006789ABCDEF:C0` sent during message transmission.

## Gateway block - sent during boot-up

The binary data sent during boot-up always seems to be 15 bytes. All values are big-endian, if endianness matters.

| Byte  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
|  0    | byte, containing the size of the package (15 bytes) |
|  1    | 32-bit value containing the seconds since boot for the gateway, often around 7s |
|  5    | 6 bytes of the gateway ID |
|  11   | word, always 1? |
|  13   | word, always 50? |

## Sensor 64-byte data block format

The binary data to transfer the packages to the server is always a multiple of 64-byte blocks with each block containing one message from a sensor. Data that is non-urgent is buffered within the gateway to minimize the number of transfers to the cloud server, it seems to be sent every 7 minutes. Only messages marked in the tx counter as events are sent immediately. If such an event occurs, all buffered packages are also sent. Pressing the button on the gateway sends all data immediately (at least on some devices), which is helpful for debugging.

Every 64-byte block has a simple 7-bit checksum. It is calculated by just summing up the first 63 bytes and storing the lower 7 bit in the last byte of the message. Bit 7 in the last byte is always 0. If the checksum is invalid, the server simply ignores the package, but still returns HTTP status 200 (= OK), probably to avoid the gateway sending a defect package over and over again.

### Offset 1: UNIX UTC Timestamp
A 4 byte UNIX UTC timestamp when the data was received by the gateway.

### Offset 5: Package Length
Length of data within the whole package in bytes. It seems to be always be the same for the same header and device ID.

### Offset 6: Device ID
6 byte device ID, which matches the sensor MAC address. The first byte is the ID, which defines the content of the data.

### Offset 12: Data
Starting here is the sensor depended data.

### Value decoding

#### Tx Counter

| Bits  | Meaning |
|------|---------|
|  15  | 0: battery good, 1:battery low |
|  14  | 0: the transmission was triggered by the internal timer of the device e.g. for thermometers transmitting the temperature every 7 minutes or sensors sending every 2 hours a heartbeat |
|      | 1: the transmission was triggered by an event, like a battery change or the trigger of an alarm sensor or the button on the device |
| 0…13 | These bits are a counter that is incremented on every new event overflowing from 0x3fff back to 0x0000. It can be used to filter out duplicate messages on the receiver side. |


#### Temperature

| Bits  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
|  15   | unknown, typically 0, but can be 1 |
|  14   | unknown, typically 0, but can be 1 |
|  13   | overflow (too hot for the sensor) and is displayed as "OFL°C" |
|  12   | sensor error occurred. It is represented as "---°C" |
|  11   | unknown, always seems to be 0. |
| 0…10  | temperature is a signed 11 bit value in 1/10°C.
|       | 0…1023 represents 0.0°C…102.3°C = value * 0.1 |
|       | 1024…2047 do represent -102.4°C…-0.1°C = (2048-value) * -0.1 |

A sensor error typically occurs if e.g. the water temperature sensor of the pool sensor is offline (e.g. no batteries). In this case the water temperature can't be reported.

#### Humidity

| Bits  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
|  15   | unknown, typically 0, but can be 1 |
|  14   | unknown, typically 0, but can be 1 |
|  13   | unknown |
|  12   | unknown |
| 8…11  | unknown, typically a value of 10, on the MA10250PRO (Outdoor sensor) it is 0 |
|   7   | unknown (MA10230 average values 1= "--" (not calculated)) |
| 0…6   | humidity is a 7 bit value and read as % |

#### Humidity with decimal place

| Bits  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10-15 | unknown |
| 0…9   | humidity is a 10 bit value in 1/10% |

#### Air quality

| Bits  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 8…15  | unknown |
|   8   | probably overflow |
| 0…7   | Counter for 50 ppm (e.g. 9 is 450 ppm) |

#### Wetness

| Bits  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
|   7   | unknown, always 1 |
|   6   | unknown, always 0 |
|   5   | unknown, always 1 |
|   4   | unknown, always 0 |
|   3   | unknown, always 1 |
|   2   | unknown, always 0 |
|   1   | unknown, 0:dry, 1:wet |
|   0   | unknown, 0:wet, 1:dry |
