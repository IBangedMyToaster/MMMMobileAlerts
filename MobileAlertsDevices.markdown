Each device has a unique device ID, which is 12 uppercase characters long. Every device within the range of the gateway is received by the gateway and forwarded to the internet, it technically is not necessary to know the ID, you can find it out by listening to the gateway.

The 12 characters are representing a 6 byte number, which is simply converted into a hexadecimal string.

The first byte is considered by Mobile Alerts the ID, like ID02 or ID08. This ID is defining the type of sensor which is transmitting and how the data is to be interpreted.

## Rain Meter Details

The rain meter is measuring rainfall in an 100cm2 area with a rocker counter, which flips over every 2.58ml. This will result in a theoretical resolution of 0.258mm/m2 – by very slowly adding a measured weight of water to the funnel and counting the switches, I would guess that the flip happens every 3ml-3.25ml, which means it reports between 10-30% too low. But as somebody said "Rain doesn't fall as accurate as we can measure it". It doesn't matter, because dust, etc. will have a greater impact on the measurement anyway. We want to know: (a) when does it rain, (b) did it rain a little or a lot. The sensor is sufficient for that.

Warning: because of it's battery power, it is not heated and therefore can't measure snow, hail or sleet.

## Factory Reset

Devices with a button can often be factory reset by holding it down until the segments fill completely.
